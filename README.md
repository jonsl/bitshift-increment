# bitshift-increment
Write a function that, without using arithmetic operators but only bit shifting, bitwise and logical operators, adds one to the number in input and returns it.

The function accepts positive and negative numbers, converts them to their absolute value and uses this last for the calculation. Return -1 when adding one will generate an incorrect result.
